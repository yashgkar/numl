**Numl** is an HTML-based language and design system that lets you create responsive and accessible high-quality web interfaces with any look. It allows you to create components and layouts you need by composing base elements and gives you a handy color management system with automatic Dark and Contrast modes.

**Numl** utilizes the power of Web Components and runtime CSS generation. It has an API to create your own elements, style attributes, and behaviors. The build step is not required, just add a script tag to your HTML file and you are ready to go!

**Your code is your design system**

**PRE-BETA VERSION, UNDER RAPID DEVELOPMENT**

With **Numl** you can:

* Create virtually **any interface** you want
* Make your interface **accessible** without fighting IDs and specifications
* Create your own element or a whole **Design System** with ease
* **Responsive layouts** with effort so little you've never seen before
* **Copy-paste** your markup from project to project, regardless of the framework used
* Add **Dark** and **High-contrast** modes to your site effortlessly
* Be calm for technical debt in markup code
* **Enjoy** while doing what you love

* [Grid playground](https://numl.design/storybook/layouts/grid-playground)
* [Markdown converter](https://numl.design/storybook/converters/markdown)
* [Before/After slider](https://numl.design/storybook/complex/before-after-slider)
* [Login form validation](https://numl.design/storybook/complex/login-form)

## Getting started

To start prototyping with **Numl** just add a single module to the page:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/numl@0.11/dist/index.js"></script>
```

That's it! No build step, no explicit function call to apply changes.

If you want to prevent flash of unstyled content then add the following tag to the `head`:

```html
:not(:defined) {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

Make sure you are using `nu-root` tags on the top-level of your app:

```html
<body>
  <nu-root>
    <nu-card>
      My first <nu-mark>Numl</nu-mark> application!
    </nu-card>
  </nu-root>
</body>
```

Now it's time to have fun!... Try to write some HTML and build awesome interfaces.

### NPM installation

Numl is also available via npm.
```bash
$ npm install numl --save
```

Import the module to your application:
```javascript

```

## Development status (v1)

Current status of development is [HERE](https://github.com/tenphi/nude/projects/1).

And here is our [Telegram Chat](https://tele.click/numldesign). (Ask your questions here!)
Also we have [Gitter](https://gitter.im/tenphi/numl).

### Browser Support

Based on [caniuse.com](caniuse.com). Real-world support table will be presented after **v1 release**.

* Microsoft Edge 16-18 (Partial support with [@webcomponents/custom-elements polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/custom-elements), 5kb)
* Microsoft Edge 76+
* Google Chrome 67+
* Mozilla Firefox 63+
* Apple Safari 10.1+
* Apple iOS Safari 10.3+
* Google Android 67+

Safari versions below 11 requires transpiling to support dynamic import.

## Development

* `npm run build` build the library to `dist`, generating four files:
    * `dist/index.js` - ES6 tree-shaking friendly module. (Exports global `Nude` object)
* `npm run dev` build the library, then keep rebuilding it whenever the source files change.
* `npm run test` run tests.

## Local playground

Run `npm start` to view test page with few examples.

## Roadmap

* More documentation
* More examples
* More tests
* TRL Support

See our [Changlelog](https://numl.design/guide/changelog).
